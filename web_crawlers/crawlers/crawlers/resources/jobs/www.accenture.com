Advertising and Social Media Cookies

Third-party advertising and social media cookies are used to (1) deliver
advertisements more relevant to you and your interests; (2) limit the number
of times you see an advertisement; (3) help measure the effectiveness of the
advertising campaign; and (4) understand people’s behavior after they view an
advertisement. They are usually placed on behalf of advertising networks with
the site operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a site and
quite often they will be linked to site functionality provided by the other
organization. This may impact the content and messages you see on other
websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to
use or see these sharing tools or play certain videos on our site.
